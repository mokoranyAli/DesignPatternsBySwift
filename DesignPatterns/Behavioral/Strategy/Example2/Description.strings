/*
What: A protocol that defines the action that we want to encapsulate. In our example, the action would be log a message.
Who: An object who contains an object who conforms the strategy. In our example, it could be an object who using the strategy log the message.
How: Specific implementations of the strategy. Each implementation is different. In our example, we would have three strategies, one for each style.


    In computer programming, the strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

ü§Ø ‚ÅâÔ∏è This definition is very theoretical, so I think we could define it easier:

    Encapsulates algorithms in classes, making them reusable and interchangeable at runtime.
