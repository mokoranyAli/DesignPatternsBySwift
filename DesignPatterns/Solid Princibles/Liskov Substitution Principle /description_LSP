• The concept of this principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote.
• Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
• The reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.
• A subclass should override the parent class' methods in a way that does not break functionality from a client's point of view.

Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming stating that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
